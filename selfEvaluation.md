# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
  - _Pretty confident_
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
  - _It was definitely a bit more of a challenge, but it felt good. I had productive struggle, but no unproductive struggle. Had to google certain things, especially for the practice exercises, but it all eventually made sense._
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
  - _I could definitely use more practice with some of the array properties required to complete the practice exercises._
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
  - _No questions currently._
